Hey {NAME} 

I wanted to fire off a quick email to welcome you to {TEAM_NAME}. On behalf of the team, I welcome you and look forward to meeting you when we’re all together on {START_DATE}. 

Now, a bit of business. I’ll be sending you another email in the next couple days. This one is more of an overview about how I tend to work with the engineers. You may find it long but it will help set your expectations of me and vice-versa. I appreciate feedback so if you have any please don’t hesitate in providing it. 

As a matter of fact feel free to contact me anytime if you have any questions and concerns. Again, don’t hesitate to ask. Its important in your first few weeks to inquire liberally. 

We look forward to seeing you we’re happy to have you aboard!
