Hi {NAME}, 

welcome to the Expand Audience team. I’m so glad you are here at WeWork.

It’s going to take a solid quarter to figure this place out. I understand the importance of first impressions, and I know you want to get a check in the win column, but this is a complex place full of equally complex humans. Take your time, meet everyone, go to every necessary meeting, write things down, and ask all the questions – especially about all those baffling acronyms and emoji.

One of the working relationships we need to define is ours. The following is a user guide for me and how I work. It captures what you can expect out of the average week working with me, how I like to work, my north star principles, and some of my, uh, nuance. My intent is to accelerate our working relationship with this document.[^1]

## Our Average Week
We’ll have a 1:1 every week for at least 30 minutes except during emergency P1 situations (See P1 section below). This meeting discusses topics of substance, not updates. I’ve created a private Slack channel for the two us of to capture future topics for our 1:1s as well as to provide a handy historic record of what we’ve discussed. When you or I think of a topic, we dump it in that channel. 

You can Slack me 24 hours a day. During daytime hours I like responding quickly.

If I am traveling, I will give you notice of said travel in advance. Unless I'm on vacation, all our meetings still occur albeit with time zone considerations.

I may work a on the weekends. This is my choice. **I do not expect that you are going to work on the weekend.** I might Slack you things, but unless the thing says URGENT, it can always wait until work begins for you on Monday.

I take vacations. You should, too. Disconnect from work and recharge. A well-rested engineer is an effective engineer. 

## North Star Principles
**Humans first.** I believe that happy, informed, and productive humans build fantastic product. I optimize for the humans. Other leaders will maximize the business, the technology, or any other number of important facets. Ideological diversity is key to an effective team. All perspectives are relevant, and we need all these leaders, but my bias is towards building productive humans.

**Leadership comes from everywhere.** I don’t believe managers have a monopoly on leadership, and I encourage non-managers to find and act on leadership opportunities (mentoring, presenting/demoing work, etc) in our teams.

**I see things as systems.** It is helpful for me to reduce complex things (including humans) into systems. I think in diagrams. I take great joy in attempting to understand how these systems and diagrams all fit together. When I see large or small inefficiencies in systems, I’d like to fix them with your help.

**It is important to me that humans are treated fairly.** I believe that most humans are trying to to do the right thing, but unconscious bias leads them astray. I work hard to understand and address my biases because I understand their ability to create inequity.

**I heavily bias towards action.** Long meetings where we are endlessly debating potential directions can be valuable, but I believe starting is the best way to make progress. This is not always the correct strategy; it annoys those who like to debate. I find communicating your thoughts and actions efficiently with others while making forward progress tends to reduce their anxiety. It also ensures you don't make yourself a single point of failure.

**I believe in the compounding awesomeness of continually fixing small things.** I believe quality assurance is everyone’s responsibility and there are bugs to be fixed everywhere… all the time.

**I start with an assumption of positive intent for all involved.** This has worked out well for me over my career. 

**I need you to know that sometimes we are in an emergency P1 situation and things will get strange.** There is an exception to many of my practices and principles and that is when we are in a P1 situation. P1 conditions usually involve existential threats to our company. During this time, my usual people, process, and product protocols are secondary to countering this threat. If it is not obvious, I will alert you that I am in this state along with my best guess of when we'll be done.

## Feedback Protocol
I firmly believe that feedback is at the core of building trust and respect in a team.

At WeWork, there is a formal feedback cycle which occurs twice a year. It is a fairly straightforward process, but time consuming. To help inform the feedback you will be requested to provide and request from others, we’ll draft a proposed set of [OKRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) for you for the next review period. These are not product or technology OKRs; these are professional growth OKRs for you.

The feeback cycle is always being improved upon so it changes a bit. For that reason I will not try to describe it. However, one thing doesnt' and it's our face-to-face meeting to discuss the results. In our face-to-face meeting, we’ll discuss and agree on your OKRs for the next period. At our following review, the process differs thusly: I’ll review you against our prior OKRs, and I’ll introduce new OKRs (if necessary). Rinse and repeat.

In addition I like to create a 30/60/90 day plan for new engineers as part of your growth plan. Your progress through the plan will be a topic of discussion during our 1:1s.

Review periods are not the only time we’ll exchange feedback. This will be a recurring topic in our 1:1s. I am going to ask you for feedback in 1:1s regularly. I am never going to stop doing this no matter how many times you say you have no feedback for me.

Disagreement is feedback and the sooner we learn how to efficiently disagree with each other, the sooner we’ll trust and respect each other more. Ideas don’t get better with agreement.

## Meeting Protocol
I go to a lot of meetings. I deliberately run with my calendar publicly visible. If you have a question about a meeting on my calendar, ask me. If a meeting is private or confidential, its title and attendees will be hidden from your view. The vast majority of my meetings are neither private nor confidential.

My definition of a meeting includes an agenda and/or intended purpose, the appropriate amount of productive attendees, and a responsible party running the meeting to a schedule. If I am attending a meeting, I’d prefer starting on time. If I am running a meeting, I will start that meeting on time. If it’s not clear to me why I am in a meeting, I will ask for clarification on my attendance. 

If you send me a presentation deck a reasonable amount of time before a meeting, I will read it before the meeting and will have my questions at the ready. If I haven’t read the deck, I will tell you.

If a meeting completes its intended purpose before it’s scheduled to end, let’s give the time back to everyone. If it’s clear the intended goal won’t be achieved in the allotted time, let’s stop the meeting before time is up and determine how to finish the meeting later.

## Nuance and Errata

**I am an extrovert** and that means that prolonged exposure to humans energizes me. I understand it can be jarring to introverts, but please let me know if you need me to back off or come back at a better time. 

**I can be brutally honest** but my intention is never to alienate or hurt another's feelings. Being honest is my way of showing respect for your time and craft. If you feel hurt by a comment I've made don't hesitate to address it with me afterwards, privately. My goal is to improve my communication with others after all.

**When the 1:1 feels over, and there is remaining time** I always have a couple of meaty topics to discuss. This is brainstorming, and the issues are usually front-of-mind hard topics that I am processing. It might feel like we’re shooting the shit, but we’re doing real work.

**When I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined** you should ask me for both clarification and a call on importance. I might still be brainstorming. These questions can save everyone a lot of time.

**Ask assertive versus tell assertive.** When you need to ask me to do something, ask me. I respond incredibly well to ask assertiveness (“Axel, can you help with X?”). I respond poorly to being told what to do (Axel, do X.”) I have been this way since I was a kid and I probably need therapy.

**I can be hyperbolic** but it’s almost always because I am excited about the topic. I also swear sometimes. Sorry (not sorry).

**I love to start new things** but I often lose interest when I can mentally see how the thing is going to finish which might be weeks or month the thing is actually done. Sorry. I’m getting better at this.

**If I am on my phone during a meeting for more than 30 seconds, say something.** My attention wanders.

**Humans stating opinions as facts** are a trigger for me.
